            Pastel de nata is a Portuguese egg custard tart pastry, optionally
            dusted with cinnamon. Outside Portugal, they are particularly
            popular in other parts of Western Europe, Asia and former Portuguese
            colonies, such as Brazil, Mozambique, Macau, Goa and East Timor.

            The cuisine of Japan was influenced by Portuguese traders during the
            16th century, and culturally important Japanese baked goods
            including pan (パン) (from Portuguese pão, bread) and castella have
            their origins in this period. Pastel de nata is one of these. In
            addition to the traditional form of the pastry, some variations have
            been developed especially for the Japanese market by adding green
            tea flavoring. This green tea pastel de nata was eventually exported
            to South Korea and other Asian markets.
